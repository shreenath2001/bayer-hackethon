# Integrated Digital Label Hackathon
In this Project, we have built a website that can be used as an application by farmers for
better understanding of their crops. This will help them explore various Bayer's products 
according to their needs and provide them detailed information about the products which is difficult to accomodate on the packaging of the products. We have also created Qr codes for the products which can be scanned by the farmers and the information about the products can be displayed on the website. These Qr codes can be printed on the packaging of the products. We also provide application for crop recommendation to farmers. Here they need to provide the details of the land and it will help them recommend the best crop for the land.
