# Integrated Digital Label Hackathon
* In this Project, we have built a website that can be used as an application by farmers for better understanding of their crops. This will help them explore various Bayer's products according to their needs and provide them detailed information about the products which is difficult to accomodate on the packaging of the products. 
* We have also created Qr codes for the products which can be scanned by the farmers and the information about the products can be displayed on the website. These Qr codes can be printed on the packaging of the products. 
* We also provide application for crop recommendation to farmers. Here they need to provide the details of the land and it will help them recommend the best crop for the land. 
* We also have feature for plant disease detection. This feature will help farmers to know the disease of the crop. They need to upload the image of the leaf/crop and the model will help in detecting the disease of the crop. 
* We have also created a feature for tracking the order, for this if we have the order id, we can track the order. 
* We have also created a feature for taking feedback from the farmers about the products. This feature will allow us to provide necessary information about the products as per the farmer's need.
